						<h2 class="entry-title">These times are difficult and we know how much you want to see something that already was, not something that could be.</h2>
						
						<p>It's difficult isn't it, rising up everyday on the same side of the bed, then spinning your body to the left and placing your feet on the same pile of dirty socks every morning.</p>
						
						<figure class="align-left"><img src="dummy/single-image.jpg" alt="Single image"></figure>
						<p>How pretty you are matters. It matters that your skin doesn't become wrinkled over time and maybe smiling less will help reduce the appearance of lines. That time you laughed so hard that you almost vomited on your friend should be left way back. Way back in the past. Brutalism is. Brutalism was. The historical implications aren't very deep when you examine it on such a cursory manner. If we keep erasing these beauties, we start to miss an important part of our history. It's been said that a city without skyscrapers is a city without a horizon. The Missing Middle. The horror of angles in the middleground of the vastness of the horizon. Let me frame what i'm trying to say:</p>
						
						<p>We love this life. We love the repetition, the extraordinary restraints that we endure every day. Every day the diswasher needs filled then emptied or anger starts bubbling up like a belch from the depth of the bottom of the bottom, where the bugs live and banana peels rot. It's troubling making sense of it, it's a struggle to deal with what i'm saying, but we need to understand brutalism, these grand gestures - Civic Castles. Unbending Phenominological Structures that appear in space are instantly impressed upon you. We're still struggling to understand it and sometimes we don't always like what we see but we keep admiring masterworks and talking about the sublime and the carrot hanging in our face and that's what it's about, convincing your self that some idea is worth going for. Just go for it you know, tell everyone about and be authoritative, don't bend. Be Brutalist.</p>
						
						<p>There's a fight happening right now.  It's between yourself and everyone our there. How do you make sense of it all? Be nice to everyone and don't say what you believe? No. Be insidious. Especially to those that are most vulnerable to those types psychological manipulations. Get in there. Be the cockroach in someones ear, but crawl in at night and you'll say, "This is one of the greatest interiors in the country!" Whether or not it's the "greatest" is irrelevant. What matters is if you believe it or not. Believe it. Or not. These times are difficult and we know how much you want to see something that already was, not something that could be. Zevidis & Ursen-Blocher Excavations want to end with one question, "Why should we keep these great Brutalist Buildings?" It's a question for a lifetime and you have yours to make, so go now and answer that question and, if you feel so compelled, sign up for our monthly newsletter.</p>

									<p>What's always been impressive to me about Zevidis & Ursen-Blocher Excavations is that they seem to have the same information as anyone else, yet they can make it sound fresh, new and relevant.

									<p>There's never been a more urgent time for a site like this. It's smart, fresh and maintains the illusion that something new is being said. Brutalism was a brilliant movement and continues to be only as brilliant as it was and nothing more really.  Props to Zevidis & Ursen-Blocher Excavations</p>
